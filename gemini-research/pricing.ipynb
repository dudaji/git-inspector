A simple Java application with Spring Boot and MySQL usually doesn't demand high CPU or memory resources. Therefore, an e2-medium instance, which provides a balance of performance and cost, is chosen. 10GB of storage is sufficient for this application and its data. The application does not require a GPU. The us-central1 region offers a good balance of cost and latency for many users.\")"
